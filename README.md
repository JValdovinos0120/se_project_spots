# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

Spots is a social media website where people can introduce themselves and share/like photos. There are options to edit your profile and add posts.

**Intro**

This project was made to test out my skills with different screen sizes as well as grid formats. Buttons on the site have hover states to indicate to the user when they are able to use the feature.
